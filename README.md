# 🌍 International Education Cost Analysis — SQL Project

This project explores the **cost of university education across different countries** by applying SQL queries in Python. It involves **data modeling, cost breakdown analysis, and insights extraction** through structured queries on normalized tables.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

### Database Creation & Cleaning:
- Designed a **relational database schema** with tables: `Universities`, `Programs`, and `Costs`.
- Cleaned and normalized data by removing duplicates and restructuring for efficient SQL querying.
- Engineered composite fields (like Total Cost) combining Tuition, Rent, Visa, Insurance, and Cost Index.

### Analytical SQL Queries:
- Identified **countries offering the lowest education costs** for specific programs.
- Calculated **total education cost estimations per university/program**.
- Determined **top affordable programs globally** using SQL aggregations.
- Analyzed **living cost impacts** on total expenses through exchange rates and living index.
- Applied **JOINS, CTEs, and aggregations** to simulate real-world database querying.
